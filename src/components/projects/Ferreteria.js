    This project involved designing and developing a stock management application for a small hardware store, created as part of a college assignment
    for the subject <i>"User-Centered Design"</i>.  The app should allow users to manage their inventory with ease.
    The focus of the design was on simplicity and efficiency to meet the needs of hardware store owners and employees.
     The project scope was limited to designing three key screens, as full app functionality was not required.

      <h3 className="mb-5">Problem</h3>
      <p>
      Hardware store owners often struggle with managing their inventory efficiently. They need to keep track of stock levels, organize products
      into categories, and ensure that new stock can be added easily. Without a proper system, this process can become cumbersome, leading to
      errors, misplaced items, and difficulties in fulfilling customer orders.
      </p>
      <p>
      Furthermore, many hardware stores lack a mobile app for inventory management, with most systems being designed for desktops. 
      A mobile app allows any employee to access the system quickly without needing to be at a computer, enhancing flexibility and making
      inventory management more efficient.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className="mar-top-100">
      <h3 className="mb-5">Solution</h3>
      <p>
      My Stock offers a simple and intuitive solution for hardware store owners to manage their inventory.
      The app provides an inventory list where users can view, edit, and track products, a menu with clear options to navigate
      between different functionalities (inventory, reports, categories, etc.), and a product entry form to add new stock with
      essential details such as category, price, and quantity. The app is designed to streamline daily operations, reduce errors,
       and improve efficiency in inventory management.
