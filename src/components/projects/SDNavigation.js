    <p className='mt-5'> 
      SD Navigation is a mobile application created to simplify public transportation.
      As the Design Lead for this UX/UI challenge, I was responsible for designing key screens that demonstrated the core user experience. 
      I focused on user research, wireframing, and high-fidelity prototypes, ensuring that the design was intuitive and visually appealing.
      The challenge required creating only specific screens rather than the full flow, allowing me to highlight the essential aspects of the user interface.

      <h3 className="mb-5">Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Pedestrians in unfamiliar cities (even their own) face significant
        challenges navigating public transportation. Often, they lack
        accessible and clear information about the various transportation
        methods available, leading to stress and wasted time. They need a
        tool that allows them to plan their journey effectively and safely,
        minimizing uncertainty about their route.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className="mar-top-100">
      <h3 className="mb-5">Solution</h3>
      <p>
        SD Navigation is an intuitive application that guides users from
        their origin point to their destination using public transportation.
        Based in the city of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. This app offers a simple interface that allows users
        to select their origin and destination quickly, with detailed routes, interactive maps,
        and travel time and cost estimates.
