      <h3 className="mb-5">Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Pedestrians in unfamiliar cities (even their own) face significant
        challenges navigating public transportation. Often, they lack
        accessible and clear information about the various transportation
        methods available, leading to stress and wasted time. They need a
        tool that allows them to plan their journey effectively and safely,
        minimizing uncertainty about their route.

        SD Navigation is an intuitive application that guides users from
        their origin point to their destination using public transportation.
